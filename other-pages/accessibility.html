  <h1>Accessibility </h1>
  
  <h2>Planning phase</h2>
  <p class="accessibility-p">
    During our planning-phase, we made a list of points we needed to follow to make our website as accessible as possible. This list included points such as: clear and concise paragraphs, clear descriptions on alt-texts, and headings, accessible and large font sizes and styles, and background-colors for different sections, as completely white websites can be a strain on the eye. We made multiple sketches and disregarded ideas that did not fit the criteria. Some members in the group have macs, while others have pcs and this ensured that we had to use universal icons (i.e. arrows) and scale our pages accordingly. Thus, all our pages use vh, vw, percentages, rem, or em, instead of pixels.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <p class="accessibility-p">
    To test our website, we used the Wave report-site continuously. At first, it told us that our website's color palette had too low contrast, so we fixed that. We changed the upcoming-events' background color from #d9af4e, yellow, to a dark blue. We also darkened index's buttons' background-color when hovered on, so it was clearer to see. To make the site more accessible, we also made sure to follow structural guidelines by using headings in the correct order and only reusing h2. For other titles we used p-classes. During the finishing-phase, we also ran the webpage through Lighthouse, which suggested using aria-labels for our social media icons.

  <h2>Other techniques</h2>
  <p class="accessibility-p">
    Other than using the Wave-report, we also used other techniques to ensure our website's accessibility. We spoke to our peers and mentors and tested the layout on them, and used their feedback to better the site. For example, they liked the layout on our "research"-section in between the "news"- and" life at campus"-sections because it broke up the page a bit.  We also included styling for our scrollbars for browsers that don't support webkit.

  </div>

  <p class="accessibility-p">
    We checked other accessibility manuals, and found more elements we needed to change. Our social media icons were spaced closer together, but we widened the spacing to make it easier for users to click on them. We also changed the hover-effect on elements with the same layout, such as the "news"-, "life at campus"-, and "meet students from"-sections, so they behave more predictably. The width on all pages, including topical, which has a lot of text, is limited to 80% to increase readability. On the "topical"-page, we also broke the paragraphs up and added a list to increase readability. The layout on all pages is easy to understand and broken up into sections, divs, and figures, which allow the user to navigate the site using their keyboard in a predictable manner.
